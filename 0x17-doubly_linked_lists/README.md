# 0x17-doubly_linked_lists

This repository contains C programs related to doubly linked lists. It explores the concepts and implementation of doubly linked lists in the C programming language.

## Files

- `0-print_dlistint.c`: This program prints all the elements of a doubly linked list.

- `1-dlistint_len.c`: This program returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.

- `2-add_dnodeint.c`: This program adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.

- `3-add_dnodeint_end.c`: This program adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.

- `4-free_dlistint.c`: This program frees a doubly linked list.

- `5-get_dnodeint.c`: This program returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.

- `6-sum_dlistint.c`: This program computes the sum of all the data (integers) in a doubly linked list.

- `7-insert_dnodeint.c`: This program inserts a new node at a given position in a doubly linked list.

- `8-delete_dnodeint.c`: This program deletes a node at a given position in a doubly linked list.

## Usage

To use any of the provided programs, you need to compile them using a C compiler. For example:

```shell
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-print_dlistint.c -o print_dlistint
$ ./print_dlistint
```

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to compile and execute the programs.

Feel free to explore and modify the programs to suit your needs. Each program contains a brief description and comments to help you understand its purpose and functionality.
